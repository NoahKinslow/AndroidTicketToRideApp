Essentially, it is a game about connecting cities with trains. Players choose goals of what cities to connect. Then, they collect cards that enable them to connect the cities using trains figurines they are given. The goals have varying amounts of points, and players get points of other actions in the game (like connecting cities on the way to their goal). The person with the most points wins. The game ends when any person has fewer than 3 train cars remaining.
